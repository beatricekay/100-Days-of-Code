# Day 28 - Tkinter, Dynamic Typing and the Pomodoro GUI Application
## Concepts Practised
* How to work with the Canvas Widget and Add Images to Tkinter
* Add a Count Down Mechanism
* Dynamic Typing
* Setting Different Timer Sessions and Values
* Adding Checkmarks and Resetting the Application

## Learning Points
* The Pomodoro Technique is as follows:
  1. **Set 1**: 25 minute work + 5 minute break
  2. **Set 2**: 25 minute work + 5 minute break
  3. **Set 3**: 25 minute work + 5 minute break
  4. **Set 4**: 25 minute work + 20 minute break
* Python allows for **Dynamic Typing** where you can change the data type of a variable just by assigning it a different value. This is not allowed in all programming languages, e.g. Java and C, where the variable must hold on to the same data type forever.
