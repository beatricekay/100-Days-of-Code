## Content
* Function with Outputs
* Multiple return values
* Docstrings
* Combining Dictionaries and Functions
* Print vs. Return
* While Loops, Flags and Recursion

## Learning Points
* Return statements indicate the end/exit of a function.

* Docstrings help to define and document a function. Add the description in """  """. Multiple lines are allowed. It can also be used as a multiline comment instead.
