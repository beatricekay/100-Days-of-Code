# Day 3: Control Flow and Logical Operators
## Content
* Control Flow with if / else and Conditional Operators
* Modulo Operator
* Nested if statements and elif statements
* Multiple If Statements in Succession
* Logical Operators

## Learning Points
* Checking if a year is a leap year: https://bit.ly/36BjS2D
* Indentation within IF/ELSE loops is important. 
* One = sign is for assigning variables. 2 == signs is for checking the equality of a value. 
* In the case of the BMI, e.g. BMI between 18.5 and 25, you don't have to specify the logic to be bmi >= 18.5 & bmi < 25 because it is already accounted for in the first loop where bmi < 18.5
* Multiple IF statements can be used in succession to stack logic conditions.
* ASCII art can be found in this link: https://ascii.co.uk/art.
* '''    ''' allows us to type a comment in paragraphs.
