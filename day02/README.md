# Day 2: Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings

# Content
* Python Primitive Data Types
* Type Error, Type Checking and Type Conversion
* Data Types
* Mathematical Operations in Python
* Number Manipulation and F Strings in Python

# Learning Points
* len() cannot be used on integers
* The method of pulling out a particular element from a string is called "subscripting"
* We can place _ underscores in integers to mimic , placeholders. E.g. 100,000 v.s. 100_000. Python will ignore the _ placeholders. It is for us to visualize longer integers better. 
* Only strings can be concatenated together. Integers cannot be concatenated. 
* We can convert an integer to a string using the str() function. Vice versa, we can convert an integer to a float using the float() function. Or a string to an integer using int().
* We concatenate with the + symbol. E.g. "123" + "456" gives "123456".
* The function type() tells us the data type. 
* Short cut to commenting out code is CMD + / (in macOS).
* Division of integers in Python gives a floating number. E.g. 6 / 3 = 2.0
* PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponent, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction
* int() rounds down while round() rounds up. round() also allows you to specify the number of decimal places you round off to. 
* // floor division gives the same result as int(), giving the result as an integer.
* += 1, /= 1 helps to divide/add to the same variable twice.
