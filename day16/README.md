# Day 16: Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
## Concepts
* Classes and Objects
* Constructing Objects and Accessing their Attributes and Methods
* How to Add Python Packages and use PyPi
* Modifying Object Attributes and Calling Methods

## Learning Points
* We model a ```class``` after waiter and each class has various waiter ```objects``` for various waiter names.
* Each waiter ```object``` can have:
  * **Attributes:** variables owned by each object\
    ```is_holding_plate = True```\
    ```tables_responsible = [4, 5, 6]```
  * **Methods:** functions owned by each object\
    ```def take_order(table, order): #takes order to chef```\
    ```def take_payment(amount): #add money to restaurant```
