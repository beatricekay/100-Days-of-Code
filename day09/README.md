# Day 9: Dictionaries, Nesting and the Secret Auction
## Content
* The Python Dictionary
* Nesting Lists and Dictionaries

## Learning Points
* To see the key values in a dictionary more clearly, we follow this format:\
dictionary = {\
  "Key1" : "Value1",\
  "Key2" : "Value2\
 }
* We can nest lists in dictionaries and dictionaries in lists vice versa.
* When we have a global variable defined outside the function, we cannot use it as a variable inside the function. 
* If we want to append a new item at the end of the list, we use the .append() method instead of assigning it to a variable +=.
* This defines a function to help us clear the console each time. 
```
import os

def clear(): # putting it in a function so you can use it many times
  os.system('clear') # clears console
```
