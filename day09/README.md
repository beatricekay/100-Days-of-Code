# Day 9: Dictionaries, Nesting and the Secret Auction
## Content
* The Python Dictionary
* Nesting Lists and Dictionaries

## Learning Points
* To see the key values in a dictionary more clearly, we follow this format:\
dictionary = {\
  "Key1" : "Value1",\
  "Key2" : "Value2\
 }
 * We can nest lists in dictionaries and dictionaries in lists vice versa.
 * When we have a global variable defined outside the function, we cannot use it as a variable inside the function. If we want to append a new item at the end of the list, we use the .append() method instead of assigning it to a variable +=.
