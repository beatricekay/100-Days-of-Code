# Day 5: Python Loops
## Contents
* Using the for loop with Python Lists
* For loops and the range() function

## Learning Points
* For range(2, 100, 2), this means that the list will start from 2 but end at 98. This is because the last number is non-inclusive. 
* Remember that in an if/else loop, if the first if condition is fulfilled it skips the other loops. You have to structure your if/else structure such that the first condition is the one that should be addressed first. 
* .shuffle() randomizes the list inputted. It does not return a list as an output.
